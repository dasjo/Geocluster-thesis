\chapter{Realization}
\label{chapter:realization}

This chapter describes the realization of server-side geo clustering for Drupal. First, an analysis based on the objectives stated in the previous chapter considers their implications for the implementation. Subsequently, the Geohash-based clustering algorithm is defined. A Geohash-based hierarchical, spatial index will be designed, as well as the actual clustering algorithm. Finally, the architecture and implementation of the algorithm for Drupal are explained in detail.
