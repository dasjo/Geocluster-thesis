Since the late 1990's a clear shift from traditional to online-based recruitment methods has taken place. The Internet offers many opportunities to the recruitment process, from which both the companies as well as the job seekers benefit. The still increasing popularity comes, among other things, from the cost and time saving advantages \cite{Meert06clustermaps}.

The importance of online recruiting has also been underlined in a recent survey in Germany, including the top 1.000 companies. According to that, 87\% of the job offers are published on the company's website, 61\% on job boards and only 20\% in the print media. Moreover, most job seekers apply through electronic channels and 71\% of the hired persons are a result of online recruitment \cite{Meert06clustermaps}.
