\chapter{Foundations}
\label{chapter:foundations}

In the following chapter, the technical foundations of cluster theory, computing spatial data and fundamental concepts of web mapping are explained. The definition of the clustering task, an overview of history of cluster analysis as well as basic definitions of cluster types, clustering techniques and proximity measures are given. 4 foundational clustering algorithms are explained to provide an overview and understanding of the basic differentiation between clustering techniques. Approaches for dealing with spatial data are laid out by discussing space order methods, space decomposition methods, Quadtrees and the Geohash encoding.
