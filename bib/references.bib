The Multi-Centroid, Multi-Run Sampling Scheme (MCMRS) has been shown to be effective in improving the k-medoids-based clustering algorithms in our previous work. In this paper, a more advanced sampling scheme termed the Incremental (IMCMRS) is proposed for k-medoids-based clustering algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed scheme can not only reduce...}},
